# Lattice Terraform templates

**This project is now included in the [Lattice](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/lattice) project**

This project contains several [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) templates to help you deploy
[Lattice](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/lattice) on your choice of IaaS.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html) installed on your machine
* Credentials for your choice of IaaS

### Configure

#### [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/):

Create a `lattice.tf` file downloading the [AWS example file](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/lattice-terraform/blob/master/aws/lattice.tf.example):

``` bash
wget --quiet https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cf-platform-eng/lattice-terraform/master/aws/lattice.tf.example -O lattice.tf
```

Update the downloaded file filling the variables according to the [AWS README](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/lattice-terraform/blob/master/aws/README.md) file.

#### [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com):

Create a `lattice.tf` file downloading the [DigitalOcean example file](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/lattice-terraform/blob/master/digitalocean/lattice.tf.example):

``` bash
wget --quiet https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cf-platform-eng/lattice-terraform/master/digitalocean/lattice.tf.example -O lattice.tf
```

Update the downloaded file filling the variables according to the [DigitalOcean README](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/lattice-terraform/blob/master/digitalocean/README.md) file.

#### [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/):

Create a `lattice.tf` file downloading the [Google Cloud example file](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/lattice-terraform/blob/master/google/lattice.tf.example):

``` bash
wget --quiet https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cf-platform-eng/lattice-terraform/master/google/lattice.tf.example -O lattice.tf
```
Update the downloaded file filling the variables according to the [Google Cloud README](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/lattice-terraform/blob/master/google/README.md) file.

### Deploy

Get the templates and deploy the cluster:

```
terraform get -update
terraform apply
```

After the cluster has been successfully, terraform will print the Lattice domain:

```
Outputs:

  lattice_target = x.x.x.x.xip.io
  lattice_username = xxxxxxxx
  lattice_password = xxxxxxxx
```

### Use

Refer to the [Lattice CLI](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/lattice-cli#lattice-cli) documentation.

### Destroy

Destroy the cluster:

```
terraform destroy
```
